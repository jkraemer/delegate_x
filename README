DelegateX
==============

This is built upon the delegate_x code from http://spongetech.wordpress.com/2008/02/12/delegate-to-the-giraffe/.

I only added support for easy delegation of attribute writers without the need to explicitly specify them.

Example
=======

delegate_x %w(login password password_confirmation email), :to => '(self.user ||= User.new)', :include_writers => true

delegate_x %w(password password_confirmation email), :methods => { :login => :username }, :to => '(self.user ||= User.new)', :include_writers => true
